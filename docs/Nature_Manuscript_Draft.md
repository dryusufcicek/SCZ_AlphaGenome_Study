## Abstract
Large schizophrenia genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified hundreds of loci, but translating non-coding signals into mechanistic hypotheses remains difficult. We analyzed 20,591 fine-mapped variants from 249 schizophrenia loci and scored regulatory effects using AlphaGenome. After posterior-probability weighting and gene-level aggregation, 483 genes had non-zero regulatory burden in this dataset. Empirical calibration against a genome-wide gene universe (19,452 genes) enabled rank-based pathway enrichment across global and modality-specific scores. In the primary weighted-score analysis, the strongest signals were in muscle-contraction and calcium-regulation terms, while modality-stratified analyses recurrently highlighted reticulophagy and adenylate-cyclase regulatory pathways. Cell-type footprint normalization using adult and fetal brain accessibility peak sets showed significant enrichment only for fetal progenitor consensus peaks (P = 0.010, enrichment = 1.04), with excitatory neuron enrichment near unity (P = 0.383, enrichment = 1.01). In orthogonal checks, 9,321 of 20,591 variants overlapped adult brain Hi-C anchors (45.27%; 1.21x vs anchor coverage expectation), and overlap with SCHEMA-flagged genes recovered GRIN2A and SP4 (hypergeometric P = 0.00364). These results provide a reproducible regulatory prioritization workflow, while also revealing dataset- and mapping-dependent constraints that should be addressed before strong biological claims are made.

## Introduction
Schizophrenia has substantial heritable risk, and the latest large-scale GWAS meta-analysis reported 287 associated loci while emphasizing enrichment in neuronal systems and synaptic biology. That study also showed that fine-mapped common-variant candidates overlap rare-variant schizophrenia genes, including GRIN2A and SP4, supporting convergence between common and rare architectures. In parallel, exome-based rare-variant analysis identified ten genes with substantial schizophrenia risk and 32 genes at false-discovery-rate significance, again highlighting neuronal and synaptic biology.

Despite these advances, most associated variants are non-coding, and functional interpretation remains the principal bottleneck. Sequence-to-function foundation models are designed to bridge this gap by predicting molecular regulatory consequences directly from DNA context. AlphaGenome is a recent unified model that accepts 1 Mb sequence context and jointly predicts thousands of tracks across chromatin accessibility, histone marks, transcriptional outputs, splicing-related outputs, and chromatin-contact modalities, with strong benchmarked variant-effect performance.

This project applies AlphaGenome to schizophrenia fine-mapped variants and integrates outputs with posterior weighting, empirical calibration, pathway enrichment, cell-type accessibility footprints, Hi-C overlap, and SCHEMA convergence checks. The purpose is to provide a transparent and fully reproducible prioritization pipeline using local project assets, while explicitly reporting where data availability or schema constraints limit inference.

## Results
We started from `data/processed/credible_sets/scz_credible_sets_official.csv`, containing 20,591 variants in 249 loci. A schema-repair step reconstructed a canonical variant-score matrix with complete SNP coverage after detecting mixed historical row formats in the scoring file. The repaired file preserved all 20,591 SNP identifiers and removed previous variant loss in downstream steps. The target gene assignment column remained missing for 302 variants.

Posterior-weighted aggregation yielded 483 genes with non-zero weighted burden. Empirical calibration against the local gene universe produced `gene_z_scores.csv` with 19,452 genes and modality-specific z-columns (`z_DNase`, `z_H3K27ac`, `z_H3K4me1`, `z_H3K4me3`, `z_CAGE`, `z_CTCF`, `z_RNA`) in addition to global `z_score`. The strongest weighted genes in this run included ENSG00000278217, TMSB4XP8, RPL23AP42, ACTC1, and RPL39P3.

In the global weighted-score enrichment (`gsea_enrichment_score.csv`), the top pathways were Regulation of Smooth Muscle Contraction (FDR 6.75e-18), Regulation of Muscle Contraction (FDR 1.24e-07), and heart/cardiac contraction regulation terms. In modality-specific analyses, top-ranked pathways consistently included Reticulophagy and Regulation of Adenylate Cyclase Activity, with significant but modest FDR values compared with the most extreme global signals. A combined top-50 summary across eight score spaces is provided in `gsea_enrichment_ALL_MODALITIES_summary.csv`.

Cell-type footprint normalization with Corces adult brain cluster peaks and Trevino fetal consensus peaks returned near-null enrichment for most adult classes, including excitatory neurons (observed 946 vs expected 936.7; enrichment 1.01; P = 0.383), inhibitory neurons (0.94; P = 0.926), and microglia (1.02; P = 0.352). The only nominally significant class after this normalization was fetal progenitors (observed 2,532 vs expected 2,424.0; enrichment 1.04; P = 0.010).

In validation analyses, 9,321 of 20,591 variants overlapped merged adult-brain Hi-C anchors, corresponding to 45.27% overlap and 1.21x enrichment relative to merged-anchor genomic coverage. SCHEMA convergence, using SCHEMA-flagged genes from the extended PGC3 table available in the local validation directory, produced two overlapping genes (GRIN2A and SP4) with hypergeometric P = 0.00364. GTEx eQTL validation remained incomplete in this run because the scripted public URLs did not return downloadable brain files; the pipeline therefore writes an explicit stub report rather than a fabricated concordance estimate.

## Discussion
This analysis is consistent with the core schizophrenia genetics literature in one narrow but important respect: overlap with GRIN2A and SP4 is recovered in the common-versus-rare convergence check, aligning with prior reports that these genes sit at the interface of common and rare schizophrenia risk architectures. Beyond that point, however, the present output profile does not replicate the strongest neuron/synapse-dominant pathway pattern reported in the foundational GWAS fine-mapping work, and this discrepancy should be treated as a primary interpretive signal rather than ignored.

Several technical features likely contribute to this divergence. First, target-gene attribution in the current variant scoring file is sparse and partly historical, with modality values available for a subset of variants only. Second, weighted aggregation in this pipeline follows a single target-gene assignment per variant, which can amplify assignment bias and distort downstream pathway composition. Third, enrichment outcomes are sensitive to the scoring distribution and background handling; although the current implementation is statistically consistent and reproducible, it is still dependent on upstream gene mapping assumptions rather than experimentally validated causal assignments.

The cell-type analysis similarly urges caution. The normalized enrichment profile does not support strong mature-neuron specificity in this run and instead points to a modest fetal progenitor signal. This does not by itself contradict prior neuronal enrichment findings from large GWAS frameworks, because those frameworks and this project use different mapping and aggregation layers; however, it indicates that claims of robust neuron-specific regulatory concentration are not warranted from the current output alone.

The practical value of this work is therefore methodological as much as biological: the repository now executes a coherent pipeline that preserves variant coverage, avoids silent schema corruption, separates explicit validation from unavailable validation, and generates internally consistent manuscript assets. The next scientific priority is not narrative expansion but data-hardening: complete modality coverage for all credible-set variants, coordinate-level harmonization against external eQTL resources, and sensitivity analyses under alternative variant-to-gene assignment rules.

## Methods Summary
Variants were loaded from the local official schizophrenia credible-set file and combined with AlphaGenome variant scores after schema normalization. Gene-level burden was computed as posterior-probability-weighted sums of target-gene effects. Empirical z-scores were derived against the full local universe of genes. Pathway enrichment used one-sided Mann-Whitney U testing with Benjamini-Hochberg correction. Cell-type overlap used merged peak footprints from adult and fetal single-cell accessibility resources with binomial testing against genomic footprint fractions. Hi-C overlap used merged adult-brain loop anchors. SCHEMA convergence used hypergeometric overlap testing against SCHEMA-flagged genes in the local extended-data table.
